##  
Welcome to our web application, *Fuel Up!* This app is the first application I've built with a team in about 6 to 7 years. I want to thank Elliot, Sean, and Ashley once again for being such great people to work with. We struggled around the halfway mark getting pressed for time as we spent too much time initially finding that AMAZING APP IDEA and not focusing on ideas that were within our capability and time frame to complete. 

We kind of bottlenecked in a way as everyone lost track of their roles and current tasks as ideas and the entire concept shifted from using this API for that purpose and so forth. So.... GREAT learning experience empowering us with that mistake we will only make once (ðŸ¤ž). Moving forward I will be keeping that multiplatform mega app on the back burner, focus on the limitations and opportunities I am presented with, and get started on an MVP that works.  

## User Story

- With the rise of electric cars hitting the roads these days with no shortage of gas-powered cars, Fuel Up gives the user a one-stop hop to the nearest station!!! Including address, phone number, distance (gas), and charging type (electric).

- Fuel Up has users enter in their address and choose the type of fueling station they are looking for. Once they click Submit, they are presented with the closest 10 results.

- User just got spouse an electric vehicle and is still truckinâ€™ down the highway with gasoline under the hood. The couple wants a quick way for drivers in either vehicle to find the closest charging station, especially in a bind when their fuel is low. -
